Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content on its own. It learns from a large amount of data and then uses that learning to produce text, images, music, videos, code, and more.

For example, Generative AI can write stories, answer questions, make pictures from text, or create new designs. Models like ChatGPT and DALL·E are examples of generative AI.

It works using deep learning methods such as GANs and Transformers, which help the system understand patterns in data and generate original outputs.

Generative AI is used in many areas like education, entertainment, healthcare, finance, and business because it helps in creating ideas, reducing human effort, and speeding up work.
